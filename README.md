## 🧠 About Me

I am a second-year **M.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science at VJTI, Mumbai**, with a strong interest in **AI research, large language models, and intelligent systems**.

My work lies at the intersection of **multilingual NLP, ASR–LLM pipelines, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and emerging quantum-enhanced learning methods**. I am currently involved in applied research projects with real-world impact, including **AI-driven FIR automation systems** and **domain-specific LLM reasoning frameworks**.

I am actively preparing for **PhD programs in AI / ML**, with research interests spanning:
- Large Language Models & Reasoning
- Multilingual NLP and Speech-to-Text systems
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- AI systems for law, governance, and public infrastructure
- Quantum Machine Learning
